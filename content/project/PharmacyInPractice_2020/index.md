summary: Pharmacists in general practice are expected to improve medication efficacy and reduce medication complications and adverse effects. In order for pharmacists in practice to be sustainable, practice revenue needs to be taken into consideration. In this short study, conducted during a period of considerable practice and societal upheaval due to a coronavirus outbreak, a pharmacist in practice was able to reduce the overall medication count (-0.52 per patient) and increase the billings (‘standard’ +0.86, ‘nursing’ +0.29, ‘case conference’ +0.04 and ‘medication review’ +0.09) of patients the pharmacist contacted. Additional revenue per patient contacted is estimated at $89.73.
