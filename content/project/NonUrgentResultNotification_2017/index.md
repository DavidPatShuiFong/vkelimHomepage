summary: Without any procedure to ‘recall’ patients who have a result marked ‘non-urgent discussion’, how many results are notified over the following weeks? During four measurement periods in 2015/2017, the Kensington site had approximately 100 results per week marked for ‘non-urgent discussion’. Although there was no mechanism to recall those patients if the result was not yet notified, about 55% of those results were notified within four weeks.
