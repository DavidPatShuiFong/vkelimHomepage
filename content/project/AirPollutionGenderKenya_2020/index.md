summary: The relationship between gender and symptoms and conditions potentially aggravated by air pollution is explored amongst school-age children seen during a screening clinic in Kibera, an informal settlement of Nairobi, Kenya. The interim results of this study finds female children had an estimated odd-ratio of 2.23 (95% confidence interval 1.17 to 4.39) of having potentially air-pollution related conditions or symptoms (such as cough, asthma or eye irritation) compared to male children.
