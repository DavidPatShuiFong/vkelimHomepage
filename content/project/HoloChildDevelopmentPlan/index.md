[Holo Child Development Plan](https://spurafrika.org/api/files/documents/holo-child-development-plan-spur-afrika-kenya-david-fong.pdf) on [Spur Afrika website](https://spurafrika.org/articles)

The development plan includes a review of the needs, requirements and provides a series of recommendations to meet the goals of an existing child development program established in 2021 by [Spur Afrika](https://spurafrika.org/) in Holo, Western Kenya.

Spur Afrika’s goals are to enable and empower children to transform their own lives and the lives of their families and communities, mainly through advancement of education. Spur Afrika in Holo aims to partner with the community through community engagement, allowing Spur Afrika to be responsive to the local community and local conditions, such as addressing barriers to education, early pregnancy and ill health. Spur Afrika’s vision is to transform the community, and replicate the transformation in multiple communities.

To be successful, Spur Afrika will need to plan its future programs, resources, staff and skill requirements while maintaining flexibility to adapt the programs in response to community feedback and achieving sustainability outcomes.

Disclaimer: This development plan was created with the kind co-operation of Spur Afrika staff. However, this plan does not formally represent the views and plans of the Spur Afrika Kenya or Spur Afrika Australia organisations or individuals within the Spur Afrika organisations.
