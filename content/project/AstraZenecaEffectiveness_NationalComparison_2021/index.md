There have been many studies, and beliefs about the relative effectiveness, or otherwise, of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination, compared to other vaccinations - such as the mRNA vaccines.

Do nations which use the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccinations have worse outcomes, in terms of reducing COVID-19 cases and fatalities, compared to nations which use less AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines?

This analysis compares nations which have vaccinated at least 35% of their population with *any* COVID-19 vaccination and had a significant number of COVID-19 cases during the Northern hemisphere winter of 2020/2021.

The findings suggest that countries which used the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine do not have inferior results to those who used less, or none, of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
