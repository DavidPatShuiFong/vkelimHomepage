I was [acknowledged as a contributor to the version 2.0.0 release of `dbplyr`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/11/dbplyr-2-0-0/)!
An acknowledgement can be found [at the bottom of the announcement page](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/11/dbplyr-2-0-0/).

[`dbplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) is the database backend for the 'data
pliers [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)' data manipulation package in
the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) software suite of [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
statistical programming language.

Or to describe from 'top-down':

* [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a computer programming language
  used by statisticians and others who want to interpret data.
  
  <br>
  
* [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of software packages for
  the `R` language which makes it easier for R users to manipulate and process data.
  So much easier, that `R` is now taught to liberal arts post-graduate students
  to analyze data e.g. for environmental studies at Harvard Extension School.
  These students often have no prior experience in computer programming.
  
  <br>
  
  The `tidyverse` was largely the creation of a New Zealander, [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/),
  and it looks like he is the chief maintainer of the `tidyverse` software.
  Like `R`, `tidyverse` is '[open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)',
  freely available for use and modification, and contributed to by many
  enthusiasts in the data science community.
  
  <br>
  
* [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is a software package in the `tidyverse`
  collection which does many of the common data manipulation tasks, such as
  filtering, changing, sorting, summarizing and selection.
  
  <br>
  
* [`dbplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) allows `dplyr` to interact with database
  backends.

*My* contributions to the free and open-source `dbplyr` are (ironically) related
to `dbplyr` operation with [Microsoft SQL Server 'MSSQL'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server).
In all credit to Microsoft, the basic versions of Microsoft SQL Server are freely
available, as are client libraries (for use in Linux), and Microsoft also provides
extensive freely available documentation.

As of 21st December 2020, my two accepted contributions ('pull requests') are:

1. [Cast `as.double` and `as.numeric` to `FLOAT` instead of `NUMERIC`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/pull/388)

   <br>

   In MSSQL, `NUMERIC` converts floating point number to integers, which is
   not what is intended for `as.double` and `as.numeric` in `R`.
   
   <br>
   
2. [Use `try_cast` instead of `cast` for MSSQL version 11+ (2012+)](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/pull/496)

   <br>

   In MSSQL, `try_cast` allows more elegant handling of invalid entries.
   `try_cast` returns `NA` (not available) in situations where `cast` will return an error.

   <br>

As of 21st December 2020, I also have a [currently open contribution](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/pull/555)
('pull request') to fix an error in my second contribution.

What I really would like to say is just how friendly Hadley Wickham and others
have been in helping me contribute to and improve `dbplyr`.

Both in [initial discussion](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/issues/379)
and in the [process of doing a 'pull request'](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/pull/496),
Hadley and [Kirrill MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/krlmlr) have answered the simplest
of queries, amended my super-clumsy code and really encouraged me along!
Hadley is an adjunct professor and something of a data science legend. I have
not attended a formal computer programming class at high school, university or
trade school, so I'm really humbled to feel like a valued contributor to
the data science world.

(And why am I so interested in improving the operation of `dbplyr` with `MSSQL`?
It is because I use `dbplyr`/`dplyr` to interrogate the [Best Practice](https://bpsoftware.net/)
electronic medical record patient information database with my 'near future'
patient care quality improvement tool [GPstat!](https://github.com/DavidPatShuiFong/DailyMeasure).)
