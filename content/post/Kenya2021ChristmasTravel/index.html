<h2>Christmas travel</h2>
<p>Travelling at Christmas time can always seem a bit hectic. There are often many competing demands, co-ordination with multiple parties and tight deadlines. This year has added uncertainty, with COVID-related concerns and travel restrictions. This has also affected the planned visit to Spur Afrika Kenya.</p>
<p>In fact, just about every ‘plan’ for the past two hears has, in project-management terms, been affected by ‘VUCA’ – volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.</p>
<p>Christmas is no stranger to VUCA, however. At the time of Jesus’s birth, VUCA even effected the Magi (‘Wise Men from the East’) who came to celebrate Jesus’s birth.</p>
<p>The Magi embarked on a long and hazardous journey with incomplete – and, by our standards, flawed – information. The Magi needed to seek additional information along the way. The person who had the resources to provide the information was the King of Judea, Herod the Great. Herod had a very ambiguous, very different intent to the Magi themselves. The situation between the Magi and Herod was so volatile, the Magi had to change their plans mid-course and depart from Judea secretly.</p>
<p>But the greatest change in plans for Magi was perhaps presenting their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to a child who did not appear ‘Great’ in the traditional power sense of the word. Yet the Magi not only presented their valuable gifts to a child of an ‘ordinary’ family, but also bowed down and worshipped Him (Matthew 2:11).</p>
<p>In these uncertain and volatile times, I pray that God can provide the clarity to adapt and flexibly and patiently respond to changes in circumstance. All the time with a clear vision - being ready to put aside pre-conceived ideas about how things should be - of the beauty that is God with us and amongst us.</p>
