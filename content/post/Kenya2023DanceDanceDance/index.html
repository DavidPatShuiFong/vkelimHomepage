<blockquote>
<p>“Praise [God] for his mighty deeds;<br />
praise him according to the abundance of his greatness.<br />
Praise him with blast of horn;<br />
praise him with harp and lyre.<br />
Praise him with tambourine and dancing;<br />
praise him with strings and flute.<br />
Praise him with sounding cymbals;<br />
praise him with clashing cymbals.”</p>
<p><em>Psalm 150:2-5</em></p>

<p>A wonderful feature of Kenyan life is community dancing and being … loud!</p>
<p>Be it at the Spur Afrika picnic day in Kibera/Nairobi (first video), or the welcome to Holo/Kisumu that the Spur Afrika children gave Rosalie and myself yesterday (second video), there seems to be no end to the dancing and singing!</p>
<p>Church services that we’ve attended are like that as well. Lots of dancing and movement (by those on stage. and the congregation). And almost deafening music!</p>
<p>Churches have, over centuries, been at the forefront of loud music and noises, be it the pipe organ (technological marvels of the day) and pealing bells.</p>
<p>Something about public praise, worship and joy the Kenyans haven’t yet forgotten!</p>
