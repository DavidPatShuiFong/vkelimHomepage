There are endless numbers of blogs out there, often providing tidbits of useful
information which I find useful. And occasionally, someone even finds *my* posts
useful and uses the [Wowchemy (Hugo Academic)](https://wowchemy.com/) 'Contact'
widget to send me a comment or question! But these questions are not attached
to any particular blog post. Wouldn't it be nice if the a viewer could comment
on an individual post in the blog?

The most commonly used commenting system on Hugo websites appears to be [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).
Disqus does have 'native' and easy support in Wowchemy. And I've certainly used
Disqus to provide feedback on *other* blogs. But there are also numerous complaints
about Disqus's speed (or lack thereof), resource intensity, advertisements and 
- even worse - potential violations of privacy.

But what - preferably free and 'open' - alternatives are there?

I initially planned to use [Staticman](https://jvblog.net/configuring-staticman-hugo/) for
commenting, but setup seemed a little involved, and I would need to register for
a (free) Heroku account.

I finally chose [utterances](https://utteranc.es), which cleverly uses [Github](https://github.com/)'s
own 'issue' system to provide comments on my blog, which is also 'sourced' from [Github](https://github.com/).

The disadvantage of utterances are

* Commenters need to have a registered Github account
  + Github is owned by Microsoft. I'm okay with that, actually.
* Comments are not 'nested'

*But* 'utterances' is very easy to set up. I used the advice from
[MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/)
and [Michele Sciponi](https://mscipio.github.io/post/utterances-comment-engine/).
The instructions at the beginning of these blogs are clear, the final instructions
at the end less so, so here are my notes for Hugo Academic version 4.8.0.

* Install 'utterances' to my website's Github repository
  + This website 'originates' from a Github repository - https://github.com/DavidPatShuiFong/vkelimHomepage
  + [Github App - utterances](https://github.com/apps/utterances)
* Retrieve/copy the 'utterances' script to be added to the blog's "comment partial"
  + The script is provided, after answering a few questions such as the location
    of the website's Github repository, at the [utterances website](https://utteranc.es/)
* Copy the script to `[ROOT]/layouts/partials/comments/utterances.html`
  + According to [Annie Lyu](https://annielyu.com) and Anabelle Laurent's 
    [talk to an 'R ladies' workshop](https://annielyu.com/slides/isugg/blogdown_aa#1)
    we **should not touch** the files in the 'themes' folder. (btw, Annie Lyu's
    blog has a good introductory post to setting up a Hugo Academic/Wowchemy
    site with R. It is what I used to get started...)
  + This concept is confirmed on Hugo's website ["Customizing a Theme"](https://bwaycer.github.io/hugo_tutorial.hugo/themes/customizing/)
  + So, create the file `[ROOT]/layouts/partials/comments/utterances.html`, **not**
    `[ROOT]/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/comments/utterances.html`
  + This is what my script snippet looks like...
  
```
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="DavidPatShuiFong/vkelimHomepage"
        issue-term="pathname"
        label="comments ðŸ’¬"
        theme="github-dark-orange"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

* Then I reference the script in `[ROOT]/layouts/partials/comments.html`
  + **not** `[ROOT]/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/comments.html`
  + I added two lines, referring to `site.Params.comment.engine 3`
  + Here is the resulting script...

```
{{ if site.Params.comments.engine | and (index site.Params.comments.commentable .Type) | and (ne .Params.commentable false) | or .Params.commentable }}
<section id="comments">
  {{ if eq site.Params.comments.engine 1 }}
    {{ partial "comments/disqus.html" . }}
  {{ else if eq site.Params.comments.engine 2 }}
    {{ partial "comments/commento.html" . }}
  {{ else if eq site.Params.comments.engine 3 }}
    {{ partial "comments/utterances.html" . }}
  {{ end }}
</section>
{{ end }}
```

* Then I reference *that* `comments.html` script by changing the settings in
`[ROOT]/config/_default/params.toml`
  + Here is the relevant part of `params.toml`
  + I added the comment about the 'Utterances' provider, and set the engine to '3'
  
```
[comments]
  # Comment provider:
  #   0: Disabled
  #   1: Disqus (https://disqus.com)
  #   2: Commento (https://commento.io)
  #   3: Utterances (https://utteranc.es/)
  engine = 3
```
