*Updated from [Calculating the practice benefit of universal bulk-billing](../UniversalBulkBilling). Updated model includes MBS Service Level A and, optionally, care plans (721/723/732)*

## Universal bulk-billing incentive

As part of an election promise, the Australian Government as of February 2025 released a [proposal](https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-mark-butler-mp/media/strengthening-medicare-more-bulk-billing-more-doctors-more-nurses) to increase the incentives for private general practices (sometimes known as 'family medicine' or 'primary care' practices) to *bulk-bill* patients. 'Bulk-billing' essentially allows a patient consultation with medical clinician to be 'free' (no out-of-pocket expense), if-and-only-if the clinician agrees to charge the patient no more than the government-set insurance price for the consultation.

The alternative to 'bulk-billing' is that the clinician charges the patient a price greater than the government-set insurance price, sometimes called *private billing*. In this case the patient pays the full price of the consultation and the government health insurance will repay the government-set insurance price to the patient.

The proposal to encourage general practices to 'bulk-bill' consisted of two parts:

-   Broadening the current bulk-billing incentive for individual consultations/services to all patients.
    -   Previously the bulk-billing incentive payment for individual consultations was only available to people, usually with less income or assets, who are [pensioners, recipients of a government-issued 'concession card' and children under the age of 16](https://www.ama.com.au/tas/bulk-billing-incentive-facts).
    -   This bulk-billing incentive is paid with each individual consult
-   If the general practice agrees to bulk-bill all patients, i.e. universal bulk-billing, the government will pay the practice an additional 12.5% over and above the government-set price for each fee-for-service item.
    -   The definition of which service items need to be 'bulk-billed', and which service items will attract the 15% bonus is not yet fully defined. The government-provided [fact sheet](https://mcusercontent.com/8a3d58d1cfb663c4dcefbc00d/files/bd321db2-d98f-0c87-efb9-1456a6053389/More_bulk_billing_fact_sheet.pdf) and [RACGP FAQ](https://www.racgp.org.au/advocacy/advocacy-resources/medicare-announcement-member-faqs) suggests that consultation items A/B/C/D, mental health care plan and other GP non-referred attendances will attract the 12.5% bonus.
    - The 12.5% bonus is paid quarterly, together with the current quarterly practice incentive program (PIP) payments.

## Will the proposed universal bulk-billing incentives be financially worthwhile for general practices?

The government has released [case examples](https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-02/strengthening-medicare-with-more-bulk-billing.pdf) of practices which would all financially benefit from the universal bulk-billing incentives proposal. [Not all real general practices have considered the incentives proposed to be attractive](https://www.medicalrepublic.com.au/tell-dohac-theyre-dreaming-re-bulk-billing-calculations-estimates/114770), however. The [benefit to real practices may be more nuanced](https://www.medicalrepublic.com.au/how-the-new-bulk-billing-offer-is-okay-bad-and-ugly/114856), depending on current private billing levels and current fees charged over the government-set price.

This model demonstrates the effect of pre-existing gap-fees, the proportion of patients which would normally be privately-billed and the inclusion of different non-referred general practice service items into the estimated profitability of adopting the proposed bulk-bill incentive program.

Two examples are presented, followed by detailed description of the model and model variations.

### Practice 1, limited item number inclusion

The first example practice privately-bills 50% of its patients. The profit-loss calculation is based on just a few item numbers ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E'). The graph below demonstrates the effect on net-profitability of adopting the bulk-billing incentives, depending on the private 'gap-fee' charged by the practice prior to adopting the bulk-billing incentives. The light-blue vertical dotted line represents the net-profitability (-8.23 per service) if the practice charged an average gap-fee of $50.

![](images/profit_gap.png)

### Practice 2, low gap-fee, care-plan item numbers included

The first example practice charges a low private gap-fee of $35. The profit-loss calculation is based on both standard numbers ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E') and care-plan item numbers. This practice did not charge a gap-fee for care-plan item numbers, even for 'private' patients. The graph below demonstrates the effect on net-profitability of the adopting the bulk-billing incentives, depending on the pre-existing proportion of patients who were charged privately before adopting the bulk-billing incentives.

The light-blue vertical dotted line represents the net-profitability (6.55 per service) if only 20% of the practice population was privately-billed.

Following sections will describe how the models were created.

## Modelling the benefits to individual practices

This model demonstrates the potential financial benefit (or loss) of taking up the universal bulk-billing proposal.

The proposition to test is:

$$
\small
\text{Benefit} \ge \text{Loss}
$$
Where *Benefit* is the benefit from universal bulk-billing and *Loss* is the revenue foregone from not charging a fee over and above the government-set price for the services.

Both the 'Benefit' and 'Loss' side of the equation can be broken down into several individual components.

$$
\small
\text{Loss} = \text{ Private services } \times {\text{Gap fee}} 
$$
*Private services* are the services which would have been privately billed before a practice agrees to universal bulk-billing. The *Gap fee* is the amount the clinician charges the patient over and above the government-set price for each service.

<!--# Note that each line in the following LaTeX equations ends with six backslashes instead of two. The reason is explained in https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder/issues/1480 -->

$$
\small
\begin{align}
\text{Benefit } = &\text{ Total fee-for-service billing } \times \text{universal bulk-billing incentive}\\\\\\
&+ \text{Private Services } \times \text{ Individual service bulk-billing incentive}
\end{align}
$$

Services which would have been previously privately billed are billed at the lower government-set price for the service, but now attract an individual service bulk-billing incentive, at least partly offsetting the *Loss* from not charging a *Gap fee*.

$$
\small
\begin{align}
\text{Total fee-for-service billing } = &\text{ Billing for bulk-billed services}\\\\\\
&+ \text{Billing for private services}
\end{align}
$$

If the practice agrees to universal bulk-billing, then all services which were previously 'bulk-billed' and previously 'private-billed' will benefit from the 12.5% universal bulk-billing incentive.

### Services

*All the 'code' below is fully modifiable, and can be changed to reflect individual practice circumstances! If you wish to 'run' the code, it is recommended that you 'run' the code blocks sequentially, from top to bottom. After you have 'run' a code block, you can modify the code and 'run' it again without running the previous code blocks.*

*If you 'Run Code' the code block below, a list of numbers in red will appear below the code block, showing the proportion of patients billed Medicare service items A, B, C, D and E.*

```{webr-r}
# Service fees for the most common fee-for-service consultation items
# which attract a bulk-billing incentive

# government-set price for service items A, B, C, D and E
# Medicare items 3, 23, 36, 44, and 123
# in AUD (Australian dollars)
fee_names <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
service_fees <- array(
  data = c(19.6, 42.85, 82.90, 122.15, 197.9),
  dim = c(length(fee_names), 1),
  dimnames = list(fee_names, "fee")
)

# the proportion which each item is billed

# raw figures are derived for calendar year 2024 Australia-wide
# http://medicarestatistics.humanservices.gov.au/statistics/mbs_item.jsp
service_proportion_raw <- array(
  data = c(4037130, 81240293, 19899953, 1609147, 174664),
  dim = c(length(fee_names), 1),
  dimnames = list(fee_names, "n")
)

# calculate the proportions
# for simplicity, assume the same proportions for bulk-billed patients
# and privately-billed patients
service_proportion_bulk <- service_proportion_raw/sum(service_proportion_raw)
colnames(service_proportion_bulk) <- c("proportion")
service_proportion_private <- service_proportion_bulk

# display the proportions
service_proportion_bulk
```

A limitation of this model is that explicit details are not known regarding which service items are required to be bulk-billed under the proposal, and which services items will attract the universal bulk-billing incentive.

Released documents show that standard fee-for-service items, particularly items 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D', will attract both bulk-billing incentives (individual service and universal bulk-billing incentive) and are required to be bulk-billed under the universal bulk-billing agreement. These are the most common service items to be charged in Australian general practice, and contribute the vast majority of practice revenue. There are other service item numbers, such as care-plan related service items ('GPMP/721', 'TCA/723' and 'GPMP RV/732'), which contribute significantly to the practice income of many practices. Care-plan item numbers will be added to an `[example model described later]({{< ref "#including-care-plan-item-numbers" >}})`{=markdown}.

### Gap fees and bulk-billing incentive

Different practices and different clinicians charge different gap fees. The same clinician or practice may charge different gap fees for different services.

The government bulk-billing incentive for individual services [varies by the location of the practice](https://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/D204B38ED29B5FC8CA258A3E000EE282/$File/PDF%20Vers%20-%201%20November%202023%20Bulk%20billing%20incentive%20items%20GP%20tables.pdf). The incentive typically increasing the less urban and more remote the location of the practice.

```{webr-r}
# note, please 'run' the previous code block! 

# Set the gap fee for the individual service items A, B, C, D and E
# for patients who were privately billed
# for simplicity, set to the same fee of $50
gap_fee <- array(
  data = rep(50, length(fee_names)),
  dim = c(length(fee_names), 1),
  dimnames = list(fee_names, "gap")
)

# the proportion of patients who are charge the gap fee
# i.e. privately billed
# set to 50%
privately_billed <-  0.5

# the bulk billing incentive, in dollars
# varies by location
# Modified Monash areas 1, 2, 3+4, 5, 6, 7
# we will index the above to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (merging areas 3+4)

# see https://www9.health.gov.au/mbs/search.cfm
n_monash <- 6 # six different Monash areas

individual_bulkbill_incentive <- array(
  # there are two different individual bulk-billing incentive fees,
  # 'standard' and 'triple'
  data = c(
    # standard bulk-billing incentive applies to service items like item A/'3'
    # items 10990, 10991, 75855, 75856, 75857, 75858
    c(7.15, 10.80, 11.45, 12.20, 12.85, 13.70),
    # triple bulk-billing incentive applies to service items like item B, C and D
    # items 75870, 75871, 75873, 75874, 75875, 75876
    c(21.35, 32.50, 34.50, 36.65, 38.70, 41.10)
  ),
  dim = c(n_monash, 2),
  dimnames = list(c("1", "2", "3+4", "5", "6", "7"), c("single", "triple"))
)

# does the single- or triple- incentive apply to the fee item?
individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee <- 
  c("single", "triple", "triple", "triple", "triple")

# set the Monash area to the city
monash_area <- "1"

# universal bulk billing incentive
# over the service fee
# set to 12.5%
universal_bulkbill_incentive <- 0.125

# show individual bulk-bill incentive applicable to defined Monash area
fee_bulkbill_incentive <- individual_bulkbill_incentive[monash_area, individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee]
# redefine dimensions of the array
dim(fee_bulkbill_incentive) <- c(length(fee_names), 1)
# change rownames to the fee names
rownames(fee_bulkbill_incentive) <- fee_names
fee_bulkbill_incentive
```

### Calculating the benefit

We can now calculate the average benefit per patient if the practice adopts universal bulk-billing.

If you 'Run Code' the block below With the default settings of 50% of patients privately-billed and a gap fee of 50, the profit-per-patient is shown as `-8.23`, i.e. a loss of 8.23. 

**Note that 'Run Code' below will not work unless the previous code blocks have already been 'Run'!!**

```{webr-r}
# note, depends on the previous code blocks already having been 'run'! 

# Benefit per 'average' patient charged service item A, B, C, D or E

net_benefit <- function(
  # calculate the average net benefit revenue
  # to the practice per patient
  
  # the variable names used in this function
  # are the same as used in previous code chunks
  # but will be 'local' to this function
  service_fees,
  fee_names,
  service_proportion_bulk,
  service_proportion_private,
  gap_fee,
  privately_billed,
  individual_bulkbill_incentive,
  individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee,
  monash_area,
  universal_bulkbill_incentive) {
  # calculate individual bulk-bill incentive applicable to defined Monash area
  fee_bulkbill_incentive <- individual_bulkbill_incentive[monash_area, individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee]
  # re-define dimensions of the 'x' array
  dim(fee_bulkbill_incentive) <- c(length(fee_names), 1)
  # change row name to the fee names
  rownames(fee_bulkbill_incentive) <- fee_names
  
  # calculate the universal bulk-bill incentive
  # for patients formerly privately-billed
  privately_billed *
    sum(service_fees * service_proportion_private) *
    universal_bulkbill_incentive +
    # calculate (and add) benefit for patients already bulk-billed
    (1 - privately_billed) *
    sum(service_fees * service_proportion_bulk) *
    universal_bulkbill_incentive +
    
    # calculate (and add) the individual service bulk-billing incentive applied
    # to patients formerly privately-billed
    privately_billed * sum(service_proportion_private * fee_bulkbill_incentive) -
    
    # calculate (and subtract) the loss from not charging a private 'gap' fee
    privately_billed * sum(service_proportion_private * gap_fee)
}

profit_loss <- net_benefit(
  service_fees,
  fee_names,
  service_proportion_bulk,
  service_proportion_private,
  gap_fee,
  privately_billed,
  individual_bulkbill_incentive,
  individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee,
  monash_area,
  universal_bulkbill_incentive
)

# Show the value of average net_benefit
formatC(profit_loss, digits = 2, format = "f")
```

#### Modifying the model for a different practice

What happens if we change some of the parameters? In this example, only 20% of services were privately-billed, the gap-fee for each privately-billed service item is $35 and the service items charged is biased towards the longer consult items.

```{webr-r}
# note, depends on the previous code blocks already having been 'run'! 

# Set the privately-billed proportion to 0.2 (20%), the gap fee to $35
# and new service proportions

new_practice_service_raw <- 
  # new A, B, C, D, E numbers
  # with much longer average consults
  #  the consult time is progressively longer from A->B->C->D->E
  c(950, 3956, 4171, 1146, 75)
new_practice_service_proportions <- 
  new_practice_service_raw/sum(new_practice_service_raw)

profit_loss <- net_benefit(
  service_fees,
  fee_names,
  service_proportion_bulk = new_practice_service_proportions,
  service_proportion_private = new_practice_service_proportions,
  # replace the gap fee for every possible service fee
  # we could also use 'gap_fee = c(35, 35, 35, 35)'
  gap_fee = rep(35, length(fee_names)),
  # reduce the privately billed proportion to 20%
  privately_billed = 0.2,
  individual_bulkbill_incentive,
  individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee,
  monash_area,
  universal_bulkbill_incentive
)

# Show the value of average net_benefit
formatC(profit_loss, digits = 2, format = "f")
```

If the gap fee is set to 35, the average consult length is longer and only 20% of patients are privately-billed, the practice can expect an average profit of `5.37` per service.

#### Including care plan item numbers {#including-care-plan-item-numbers}

The [RACGP FAQ](https://www.racgp.org.au/advocacy/advocacy-resources/medicare-announcement-member-faqs) suggests that non-referred general practice service items such as care-plans and health assessments will also qualify for the new bulk-bill incentive payments. We can add these service items to our model. We will base this model on the `[second practice model]({{< ref "#modifying-the-model-for-a-different-practice" >}})`{=markdown}.

*Model limitation - It is expected that the service item numbers and descriptors for general practice care-plans (721, 723 and 732) will change late in 2025. This model assumes that the fee-for-service revenue for the practice through care-plans will remain similar after the change in care-plan services items occurs.*

Compared to the `[second practice model]({{< ref "#modifying-the-model-for-a-different-practice" >}})`{=markdown} described above, adding care plan item numbers increases the average profit from `5.37` to `6.55` per service.

```{webr-r}
# note, depends on the previous code blocks already having been 'run'! 

# this model is based on the second practice model described above
# add new service fee descriptions
new_fee_names <- c(
  fee_names,
  # append items 721, 723 and 732
  c("GPMP", "TCA", "CDM RV")
)
new_service_fees <- array(
  # append fees for 721, 723 and 732
  data = c(service_fees, 164.35, 130.25, 82.10),
  dim = c(length(new_fee_names), 1),
  dimnames = list(new_fee_names, "fee")
)
new_gap_fee <- c(
  rep(35, 5),
  # no gap fees were charged for thes GPMP/TCA/GPMPRV items,
  # even 'private' patients
  rep(0, 3)
)
new_individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee <- c(
  individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee,
  rep("single", 3)
)
# Set the privately-billed proportion to 0.2 (20%), the gap fee to $35
# and new service proportions
new_practice_service_raw <- 
  # new A, B, C, D, E numbers
  # (long average consults)
  # and GPMP/TCA/reviews
  c(950, 3956, 4171, 1146, 75, 416, 402, 255)
new_practice_service_proportions <- 
  new_practice_service_raw/sum(new_practice_service_raw)

profit_loss <- net_benefit(
  service_fees = new_service_fees,
  fee_names = new_fee_names,
  service_proportion_bulk = new_practice_service_proportions,
  service_proportion_private = new_practice_service_proportions,
  # replace the gap fee for every possible service fee
  # we could also use 'gap_fee = c(35, 35, 35, 35)'
  gap_fee = new_gap_fee,
  # reduce the privately billed proportion to 20%
  privately_billed = 0.2,
  individual_bulkbill_incentive,
  individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee = new_individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee,
  monash_area,
  universal_bulkbill_incentive
)

# Show the value of average net_benefit
formatC(profit_loss, digits = 2, format = "f")
```

### Graphing the benefit

#### Different gap fees

We can look at the effect on profit-loss by looking at a range of different gap fees. This graph is based on the first, original, example.

```{webr-r}
# note, depends on the previous code blocks already having been 'run'! 

# This code chunk requires a few extra code packages
# It will take a few seconds to make these packages available
install.packages("tibble", quiet = TRUE)
install.packages("ggplot2", quiet = TRUE)
install.packages("ggthemes", quiet = TRUE)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

# gap fees from $0 to $60
gap_fee_range <- seq(from = 0, to = 60, by = 1)

profit_loss <- sapply(
  X = gap_fee_range,
  function(x) {
    net_benefit(
      service_fees,
      fee_names,
      service_proportion_bulk,
      service_proportion_private,
      # set the gap fee to 'x'
      gap_fee = rep(x, length(fee_names)),
      privately_billed,
      individual_bulkbill_incentive,
      individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee,
      monash_area,
      universal_bulkbill_incentive
    )
  }
)

gap_vs_profit <- tibble(
  gap = gap_fee_range,
  profit_loss = profit_loss
)

ggplot(
  data = gap_vs_profit, 
  mapping = aes(x = gap, y = profit_loss)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Gap fee ($)",
    y = "Profit-loss ($)"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Net benefit to practice, per service") +
  geom_vline(
    # our current gap-fee
    xintercept = gap_fee,
    linetype = "dotted",
    color = "blue"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    # zero profit-loss line
    yintercept = 0,
    linetype = "dashed",
    color = "red",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  theme_economist()
```

The above code chunk creates a plot like this, with a dashed red line at 'zero' profit and a dotted blue line representing the current gap fee:

![](images/profit_gap.png)

#### Different previous gap-billing proportion

Likewise, we can examine the effect on net benefit through a range of different proportion of patients being privately billed prior to adopting universal bulk-billing. This graph is based on the second example.

```{webr-r}
# note, depends on the previous code blocks already having been 'run'! 
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

# privately billed range from 0 to 100%
privately_billed_range <- seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 1)

# this model is based on the second practice model described above
# together with care plan item numbers
# add new service fee descriptions
new_fee_names <- c(
  fee_names,
  # append items 721, 723 and 732
  c("GPMP", "TCA", "CDM RV")
)
new_service_fees <- array(
  # append fees for 721, 723 and 732
  data = c(service_fees, 164.35, 130.25, 82.10),
  dim = c(length(new_fee_names), 1),
  dimnames = list(new_fee_names, "fee")
)
new_gap_fee <- c(
  rep(35, 5),
  # no gap fees were charged for thes GPMP/TCA/GPMPRV items,
  # even 'private' patients
  rep(0, 3)
)
new_individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee <- c(
  individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee,
  rep("single", 3)
)
# Set the privately-billed proportion to 0.2 (20%), the gap fee to $35
# and new service proportions
new_practice_service_raw <- 
  # new A, B, C, D, E numbers
  # (long average consults)
  # and GPMP/TCA/reviews
  c(950, 3956, 4171, 1146, 75, 416, 402, 255)
new_practice_service_proportions <- 
  new_practice_service_raw/sum(new_practice_service_raw)

profit_loss <- sapply(
  X = privately_billed_range,
  function(x) {
    net_benefit(
      service_fees = new_service_fees,
      fee_names = new_fee_names,
      # set service proportions to longer consults
      service_proportion_bulk = new_practice_service_proportions,
      service_proportion_private = new_practice_service_proportions,
      # set the gap fee to $35
      gap_fee = new_gap_fee,
      # set privately billed proportion to 'x'
      # divide by 100 to convert from
      # percentage to proportion
      privately_billed = x/100,
      individual_bulkbill_incentive,
      individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee = new_individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee,
      monash_area,
      universal_bulkbill_incentive
    )
  }
)

gap_vs_profit <- tibble(
  gap = privately_billed_range,
  profit_loss = profit_loss
)

ggplot(
  data = gap_vs_profit, 
  mapping = aes(x = gap, y = profit_loss)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Privately-billed proportion (%)",
    y = "Profit-loss ($)"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Net benefit to practice, per service") +
  geom_vline(
    # our current proportion
    xintercept = 20,
    linetype = "dotted",
    color = "blue"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    # zero profit-loss line
    yintercept = 0,
    linetype = "dashed",
    color = "red",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  theme_economist()
```

The above code block will produce a graph as below.

We can reproduce part of the table shown in the [government-provided fact sheet](https://mcusercontent.com/8a3d58d1cfb663c4dcefbc00d/files/bd321db2-d98f-0c87-efb9-1456a6053389/More_bulk_billing_fact_sheet.pdf) representing the total payments received (both individual bulk-billing incentive and universal bulk-billing incentive) for each service for those practices which agree to universally bulk-bill. The original table is shown below:

**Note that 'Run Code' below will not work unless the previous code blocks have already been 'Run'!!**

```{webr-r}
#| results: 'asis'

install.packages("knitr", quiet = TRUE)
library(tibble)
library(knitr)

# just include service items B, C and D
short_service_list <- service_fees[c("b", "c", "d"),]

new_payments <- 
  tibble(
    Current = num(
      short_service_list,
      digits = 2
    ),
    Metro = num(
      short_service_list*(1+universal_bulkbill_incentive)+
        individual_bulkbill_incentive[1, 2],
      digits = 2
    ),
    Regional = num(
      short_service_list*(1+universal_bulkbill_incentive)+
        individual_bulkbill_incentive[2, 2],
      digits = 2
    ),
    `Large Rural` = num(
      short_service_list*(1+universal_bulkbill_incentive)+
        individual_bulkbill_incentive[3, 2],
      digits = 2
    ),
    `Small Rural` = num(
      short_service_list*(1+universal_bulkbill_incentive)+
        individual_bulkbill_incentive[4, 2],
      digits = 2
    ),
    Remote = num(
      short_service_list*(1+universal_bulkbill_incentive)+
        individual_bulkbill_incentive[5, 2],
      digits = 2
    ),
  )

kable(new_payments, format = "html")
```

The above code block output is shown below, matching the table in the [fact sheet](https://mcusercontent.com/8a3d58d1cfb663c4dcefbc00d/files/bd321db2-d98f-0c87-efb9-1456a6053389/More_bulk_billing_fact_sheet.pdf).
