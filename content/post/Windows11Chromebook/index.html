<h2>Using Windows 11 Chromebook (using the ‘Crostini’ Linux container)</h2>
<p>My Chromebook, an Asus CX9 with i7-1165G7 CPU and 16GB of memory,
is extremely versatile. It can operate Android apps which are not available for
Linux e.g. <a href="https://www.pleco.com/">Pleco</a> (a Chinese dictionary) and the
<a href="https://www.youversion.com/the-bible-app/">YouVersion Bible App</a>, as well
as powerful and useful Linux applications such as <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, a data analysis environment,
and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, an academic citation tool.</p>
<p>Using and application compatibility layer such as <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/">CodeWeavers Crossover</a>,
some Windows such as <a href="https://wenlin.com/">Wenlin</a> (a Chinese dictionary), work just fine,
and Microsoft Office more-or-less works, with encouragement.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it is nice to have a complete Windows virtual machine available.</p>
<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> doesn’t work, because of
a current lack of nested KVM support.</p>
<p>There is a paid option to run a Windows virtual machine, <a href="https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/chrome/">Parallels</a>. However, using
Parallels currently requires Chromebook to be set up as an Enterprise chromebook.
<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-10-chrome-os/">This can be done on a ‘home-user’ Chromebook</a>,
but the process is involved, and a bit expensive!</p>
<p>However, there is also a free virtual machine (qemu) to install Windows.
The process is described on <a href="https://beebom.com/how-install-windows-11-chromebook/">Beebom</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the process described on Chrome Unboxed, which works for me.</p>
<div id="optimising-performance" class="section level3">
<h3>Optimising performance</h3>
<p>Running Windows 10 on my Lenovo Flex 5 (i5 tenth generation) was a bit slow, to
say the least. I was keen to improve the performance of Windows 11 on my Asus CX9.
The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChromeOSFlex/comments/ucno4b/qemukvm_virtmanager_windows_vm_very_slow/">guide from farmerbb in ‘QEMU/KVM virt-manager vm very slow’</a>
was particularly helpful. I didn’t actually use <a href="https://leduccc.medium.com/improving-the-performance-of-a-windows-10-guest-on-qemu-a5b3f54d9cf5">Leducc’s article ‘Improving the performance of a Windows Guest on KVM/QEMU’</a>,
but it looks pretty informative, too.</p>
<p>Like farmerbb, I applied all possible Hyper-V enlightenments.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;hyperv&gt;
  &lt;relaxed state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;vapic state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;spinlocks state=&#39;on&#39; retries=&#39;8191&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;vpindex state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;synic state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;stimer state=&#39;on&#39;&gt;
    &lt;direct state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;/stimer&gt;
  &lt;reset state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;frequencies state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;reenlightenment state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;tlbflush state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;ipi state=&#39;on&#39;/&gt;
&lt;/hyperv&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I disabled all timers except for <code>hypervclock</code>. Like farmerbb, and unlike some
other guides, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/80p1q7/high_kvmqemu_cpu_utilization_when_windows_10/">I left <code>hpet</code> disabled</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;clock offset=&#39;localtime&#39;&gt;
  &lt;timer name=&#39;rtc&#39; present=&#39;no&#39; tickpolicy=&#39;catchup&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;timer name=&#39;pit&#39; present=&#39;no&#39; tickpolicy=&#39;delay&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;timer name=&#39;hpet&#39; present=&#39;no&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;timer name=&#39;kvmclock&#39; present=&#39;no&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;timer name=&#39;hypervclock&#39; present=&#39;yes&#39;/&gt;
&lt;/clock&gt;</code></pre>
<p>One particular caution I have with farmerbb’s guide is that the CPU pinning settings
is specifically for his 6-core CPU, so blind copying of those settings will probably
mismatch virtual cores e.g. matching core 1 to core 6. Some other articles mention
getting the pinning setting wrong is a likely cause of <em>worse</em> performance. Currently,
I have set any cCPU pinning.</p>
<p>I downloaded the <a href="https://github.com/virtio-win/virtio-win-pkg-scripts/blob/master/README.md">Windows virtio drivers</a>
as suggested by farmerbb. I placed both my Windows and virtio driver ISO (currently named ‘virtio-win-0.1.240.iso’) into the Crostini ‘normal’ user’s <code>Download</code> directory. Trying
to install with those ISOs from a directory outside the Crostini directories did
not work, for some reason QEMU managed to lose contact with the files during the install
process. Unlike the QEMU XML snippet provided by farmerbb, I did not provide the <code>address</code>,
as this appears to be auto-generated, and did not set <code>cache</code>. Note that the disk
file is stored in the <code>libvirt</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;disk type=&#39;file&#39; device=&#39;disk&#39;&gt;
  &lt;driver name=&#39;qemu&#39; type=&#39;qcow2&#39; io=&#39;threads&#39; discard=&#39;unmap&#39; iothread=&#39;1&#39; queues=&#39;6&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;source file=&#39;/var/lib/libvirt/images/win11.qcow2&#39;/&gt;
  &lt;target dev=&#39;vda&#39; bus=&#39;virtio&#39;/&gt;
&lt;/disk&gt;</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://ostechnix.com/solved-cannot-access-storage-file-permission-denied-error-in-kvm-libvirt/">Standard users cannot access the <code>libvirt</code> directory</a>!</p>
<p>I followed Method 1 in the <a href="https://ostechnix.com/solved-cannot-access-storage-file-permission-denied-error-in-kvm-libvirt/">Ostechnix article</a>!).
As sudo, I edited the <code>/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf</code> file, adding:</p>
<pre><code>user = &quot;myusername&quot;
group = &quot;libvirt&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Then restarting the <code>libvirtd</code> service, and making sure my regular user is part
of the <code>libvirt</code> group.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(whoami)</code></pre>

<h3>Resizing Windows 11 guest window, Spice guest tools, Secure boot</h3>
<p>I installed <a href="https://www.spice-space.org/download.html">Spice guest tools</a>, but
it didn’t seem to be working, especially window resizing. The eventual solution
was provided by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41990600/virt-manager-guest-resize-not-working">‘Wind Slightly’ in the post ‘virt-manager guest resize not working’</a>.</p>
<p>It appears that the secure boot option in the boot manager/BIOS does not allow
the spice guest tools to work. I entered the QEMU Windows 11 machine BIOS (by
pressing the Escape key during boot, from memory) and disabled secure boot. After
that, windows resize worked properly.</p>

<div id="inactive-network-as-seen-in-virt-manager" class="section level3">
<h3>Inactive network (as seen in virt-manager)</h3>
<p>For some reason, the network became disabled, as could be seen in the virt-manager GUI.</p>
<p>I was able to restart the network with the instructions included in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/6iwth1/network_default_is_not_active_after_every/">post written by elattlat</a></p>
<pre><code>sudo virsh net-autostart default
sudo virsh net-start default</code></pre>

<div id="sharing-files-between-windows-in-crostini-and-linux-in-crostini" class="section level3">
<h3>Sharing files between Windows (in Crostini) and Linux (in Crostini)</h3>
<p>This is difficult, and nowhere near as easy as using Virtualbox.</p>
<p>One ‘trick’ is to use the <a href="https://remmina.org/">Remmina</a> remote desktop client,
and <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/165554/shared-folder-between-qemu-windows-guest-and-linux-host">share a folder using the Remmina GUI</a>.
My particular Remmina client is not quite as pretty as shown in the stackexchange
post. A share folder could only be specified in a saved configuration, and the
name of the share folder could only be specified by text (no directory chooser!).
In my case, the name of the share folder was a folder in the user’s home directory.</p>
<p>I enabled remote desktop protocol in Windows using the guide in <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/setup-use-remote-desktop-windows-10/">groovypost</a>.
The server name I chose in Remmina was the IP address of the virtual machine (as
can be seen in the virt-manager). The username I set to my Windows login
(e.g. <a href="mailto:myusername@outlook.com" class="email">myusername@outlook.com</a>). One tricky thing with using the Windows login is
that <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1715525/how-to-login-windows-remote-desktop-rdp-in-windows-11-when-microsoft-account-a">my ability to use passwords in Windows 11 was disabled in my virtual machine</a>! I needed to disable Windows Hello/PIN to enable password logins with
remote desktop (RDP). The superuser page has suggestions about how to use
multi-factor-authentication (MFA) instead.</p>
<p>In my case, using remote desktop via Remmina also seemed to provide better Windows
GUI responsiveness (compared to using the QXL driver in virt-manager),
with no appreciable penalty in CPU usage.</p>
