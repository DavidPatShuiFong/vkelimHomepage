<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://medicalpantry.org/">Medical Pantry</a> for partnering with Spur Afrika to provide much needed basic treatment supplies for Spur Afrikaâ€™s mobile clinics this coming January 2023.</p>
<p>Medical Pantry co-ordinates the collection and use of no-longer needed medical supplies to promote both sustainability and improved healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>Spur Afrika, its workers and partnering healthcare providers, will use these supplies to help treat some basic conditions - e.g.Â wound care - for those in the informal settlement (slum) of Nairobi as well as the poor rural areas of western areas in Kenya.</p>
<p>Thanks to Medical Pantry for supplying a â€˜coatâ€™ and â€˜fishâ€™ to global brothers and sisters in need! (James 2:15-16, Luke 11:11)</p>
<p>Rosalie and myself are leaving for Kenya soon (December 31st). Pray for our preparation and good health. And working transport (!!) as we do some final errands.</p>
<p>We are having some help soon with packing all the needed supplies, more on that later ðŸ˜Š!</p>
