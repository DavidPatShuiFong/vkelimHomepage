<p>Proof of life photo!! We made it safely to Kenya!!</p>
<p>There was some waiting &amp; disorganisation checking our documents when we got to Kenya
but we managed to get through quickly. We waited a longer time for our luggage.</p>
<p>Also had use my assertiveness with customs to not charge us tax on our luggage…</p>
<p>Thank you Sue, Patoh for coming out to pick us past midnight.</p>
<p>Flight wasn’t too bad. But the journey felt very long and wearing a mask for over
33 hours was a challenge. Surprised that everyone was wearing it.</p>
