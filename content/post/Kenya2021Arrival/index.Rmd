Proof of life photo!! We made it safely to Kenya!!

There was some waiting & disorganisation checking our documents when we got to Kenya
but we managed to get through quickly. We waited a longer time for our luggage. 

Also had use my assertiveness with customs to not charge us tax on our luggage...

Thank you Sue, Patoh for coming out to pick us past midnight. 

Flight wasn't too bad. But the journey felt very long and wearing a mask for over
33 hours was a challenge. Surprised that everyone was wearing it.
