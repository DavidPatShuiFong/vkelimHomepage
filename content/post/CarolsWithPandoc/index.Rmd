## Converting lyrics (in text/'markdown' format) to PowePoint

Christmas carols and worship songs lyrics are easily (and sometimes freely)
available across the Internet. One source is [SongSelect (by CCLI)](https://songselect.ccli.com),
though [SongSelect](https://songselect.ccli.com) is *not* free, but does help
congregations support song-writers by paying appropriate royalty fees.

A popular and (almost) universal presentation format is
[PowerPoint (by Microsoft)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint).
Unfortunately, creating song lyric slides from PowerPoint can be a painful and
slow process. Lyric slides might only contain two or three lines per slide!
So a lot of slides might need to be created for a single song.

[**Pandoc**](https://pandoc.org/) to the rescue! Pandoc can rapidly convert a text
file (such as lyrics) to another format, such as PowerPoint slides!

The gory details are described in the [Pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html),
but here's a summary, followed by example files.

* Create a *Powerpoint template*
  + As described in the manual, create a default template with pandoc with <br> `pandoc -o custom-reference.pptx --print-default-data-file reference.pptx`
  + Edit the created template's **slide master** with PowerPoint.
    - Note that the **master** needs to be edited, not the slides!
  + There are four slides to edit, the *title slide*, *title and content*, *section header* and *two (column) content*.
    - The only slide that I really needed to edit for typical lyrics PowerPoints is *title and content*
    - I moved the *title* of *title and content* to the bottom, so it will where I will place
     copyright information.
    - I restricted the main body (lyrics) of the slide to the top half of the slide.
  + Save the created template. I saved it as `.potx` PowerPoint template.
* Create a lyric file in markdown '.md' format
  + This is 'just' a textfile.
  + Separate slides with `---`. The `---` needs to be preceded and followed by a blank line.
  + '#' titles, in my template, are used to designate copyright information. Titles must be placed at the beginning of the slide.
* Process the markdown file with `pandoc`
  + `pandoc --to pptx --from markdown+hard_line_breaks --reference-doc pandoc_pptx_reference_worship.potx --output output.pptx lyrics.md`
    - the name of my template is `pandoc_pptx_reference_worship.potx`
    - `hard_line_breaks` modification to `markdown` specifies that each newline in the lyrics actually does create a new line!

Very small lyrics 'markdown' example:

```
# （C） Chris Tomlin | Ed Cash | George Frideric Handel | Isaac Watts | Matt Gilder

Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let ev'ry heart prepare Him room
 
---

And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
```

*Bonus feature* - It is easy to import and convert the 'markdown' text file into
the lyrics manager of other presentation software, such as [**Easyworship**](https://www.easyworship.com/).

### Example files

* Markdown lyrics file for ['Joy To The World'](/document/PandocWorship/lyrics.md)
  + includes comments
  + includes a verse in Chinese using the 'two column' PowerPoint master template.
* An example [template](/document/PandocWorship/pandoc_pptx_reference_worship.potx)
  + I have only used the **title and content** master template component
  + Text is white bold version of Calibri, with black outlines
  + Slides backgrounds are a very dark blue
  + The *title* of the **title and content** master template is at the *bottom* of
    the slide, with a smaller font. Intended to be used for copyright information.
    Note that the 'title/copyright' *needs* to be at the 'beginning' of
    the slide description.
  + The *title* of the **two column** master template is still at the top of the slide
    - the 'left column' (Chinese) uses a font which is not outlined, or bold
