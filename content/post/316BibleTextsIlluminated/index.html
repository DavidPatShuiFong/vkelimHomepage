<p><a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Euno/316.html">3:16 Bible Texts illuminated</a>, a book written by well-known computer scientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_E_Knuth">Donald E. Knuth</a>. Studies in reasonable detail the sixteenth verse of the third chapter of the books in the Bible. Beautifully illustrated (‘illuminated’) by calligraphers such as Hermann Zapf (who illustrated the John 3:16 verse above), Professor Knuth provides an overview of theological research, as well as his own thoughts, about each verse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Euno/things.html">Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About</a> (also available through <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Things-Computer-Scientist-Rarely-Talks/dp/157586326X">Amazon</a>) is his account of his study and research in order to write and create the ‘3:16’ book. The account is actually a transcript of his lectures to, it seems, a mostly agnostic or atheist computer science student audience. The book reminds me quite strongly of Medawar’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Advice-Young-Scientist-P-Medawar/dp/0465000924">“Advice to a Young Scientist”</a>, though covering different subject matter. ‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’ is interesting, both as a description of his journey in faith and also how an academic mathematician can approach the study of the Bible (no, Knuth is not a numerologist).</p>
<p>Some of the tools Knuth used to study the Bible in depth, such as Strong’s Greek and Hebrew concordances (available in <a href="https://www.crosswire.org/">CrossWire</a>) and the Pulpit Commentary (available on <a href="http://www.biblesupport.com/e-sword-downloads/file/1275-the-pulpit-commentary-droid-mysword-version/">eSword/MySword</a>), are now quite cheap, or free, and easy to use in this digital age.</p>
