🤩🥳😝😜🤩😝 PRAISE GOD for getting us through to this stage! 
It's been lovely to have a break in South Australia, enjoy Christmas with our families and we also had a great time celebrating my birthday with a mega party!

The news is: We are leaving for Kenya on SATURDAY!! 😅🥲🤣

Please pray that:

* we can pack what is needed.  We have lots of medical equipment, stationary, clothes, essential goods to take.  Pray that we don't get hassled too much when we land in Kenya.  We thank Grace in advance with helping us pack.  We also thank Grace for taking us to the airport on Saturday.  Pray for smooth check in and that our flight will run on time.  
* we will be flying to Doha (with a short stopover).  Pray that I don't get too sick (I am not a good flyer). We arrive in Kenya on new years day!  
* Praise God that we have managed to raise nearly all the funds needed for 2022!  This is amazing! It was a source of worry and stress so we are so thankful that we can leave for Kenya knowing that we aren't behind on funds.  There are still 2 more children to be sponsored. 
* good health.  We don't need to COVID test but it is still on the back of our minds.  We will be bringing some RATs and wearing masks when we can, however we know there is still a risk of getting it.  Also, I think I have recovered from glandular fever, but still trying to pace myself (yep, extroverts are not great at resting). 

Thanks for reading!  Please continue to pray for us!  Here are a few photos of what we are trying to take.....
