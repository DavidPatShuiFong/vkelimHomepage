<p>Although this Spur Kenya Trip (25th December 2021 to 6th January 2022) has been planned
- in one form or another - for a while, the finalization of detail has been
something of a ‘surprise’.</p>
<p>There has been not as much time to prepare as usual, I have been really touched by
the individual expressions and provision of support: in words, technical advice and
offers of practical assistance. Even to the extent of taking care of a
bunny rabbit (thanks R, V and P!). And sincere concern and measures to mitigate
the peculiar circumstances of the past two years.</p>
<p>(thanks J!)</p>
