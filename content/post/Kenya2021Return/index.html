<p>Touch down!! We are back in Melbourne safely!! 😁😆</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, encouragement and prayers. God is great!</p>
<p>It was very fast getting out of the airport, they didn’t check any of our COVID documents. And apparently we only need to get a rapid test (which we will do soon), however as both David and I are working in sensitive sittings we will still go and get a PCR.</p>
<p>The flight was also smooth enough. Thankfully it wasn’t a full flight so we could stretch out.</p>
<p>Please continue to pray for Spur as we have more events and sponsors to find! So, stay in touch.🥰😍🤩</p>
