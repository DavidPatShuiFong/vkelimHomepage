Hello from Doha!! Flight from Melbourne was pretty smooth.

Thanks for all the prayers & birthday messages. I am currently enjoying some cake and watching the planes take off.

We have nearly a day to kill at the airport. Our flight isn't till tonight, so pray we can keep ourselves occupied. 

1 more flight to go till Kenya. We pray we have all the correct documentation to get into Kenya.
