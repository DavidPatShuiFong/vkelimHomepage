<p>It’s boarding time!</p>
<p>We nearly had all the correct paperwork. There was a stack of paperwork they asked us for.
I had to do a Kenyan surveillance form on the spot, but the flight attendant was happy to help.</p>
<p>All our luggage got checked in and the airport isn’t too busy. Praise God!</p>
<p>Even got to have some cake before we board.</p>
<p>Praying for a safe flight to Doha.</p>
