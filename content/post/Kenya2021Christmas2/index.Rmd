It's boarding time!

We nearly had all the correct paperwork. There was a stack of paperwork they asked us for.
I had to do a Kenyan surveillance form on the spot, but the flight attendant was happy to help.

All our luggage got checked in and the airport isn't too busy. Praise God!

Even got to have some cake before we board.

Praying for a safe flight to Doha.
