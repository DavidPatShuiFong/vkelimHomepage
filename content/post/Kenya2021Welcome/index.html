<p>Hello friends!</p>
<p>Welcome to the support, encouragement &amp; prayer group for Rosalie and David. We are planning to start our journey on Dec 25th and to come back on Jan 7th.</p>
<p>Our aims for this trip are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to encourage the workers and children in Kibera</li>
<li>health clinic day for the <a href="https://spurafrika.org/">Spur Afrika</a> sponsored children in Kibera</li>
<li>giving out cards and gifts for the children.<br />
</li>
<li>training for the Spur workers / program evaluation / better communication</li>
<li>meeting and encouraging our new worker Andrew in rural Kenya (Holo, Kisumu)</li>
<li>going to schools in rural Kenya / visiting sponsored children &amp; understanding their needs so that we can establish a new office in Holo, Kisumu</li>
<li>meeting with locals and establishing <a href="https://spurafrika.org/">Spur Afrika</a> in a new area - trying to start a Sunday program for children</li>
</ul>
<p>We would love your prayers and thoughts. We have lots of paperwork and COVID related things to sort out before we go.</p>
<p>Please pray:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenya visa to be approved ASAP</li>
<li>collection of gifts / packing (to bring to Kenya)</li>
<li>COVID testing protocol to be smooth - for us to NOT be exposed and not to test positive before we leave</li>
<li>all the relevant paperwork and applications to be completed in a timely manner</li>
<li>peace for family members and friends</li>
</ul>
