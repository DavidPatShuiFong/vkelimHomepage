[German and English libretto/text](/Paulus/) to St. Paul (Paulus), an oratorio composed by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. As far as I can tell, this oratorio is infrequently performed or recorded these days. A [good recording was made by EMI in 1977](https://www.amazon.com/Mendelssohn-Paulus-Felix/dp/B000005GPP). Some recordings do not include an English text!

This `translation' was completed early in 2002. Also available as [PDF version](/document/Paulus.pdf), [$\LaTeX$](/document/Paulus.tex) and [LyX](/document/Paulus.lyx) files. Please contact me regarding any errors.
