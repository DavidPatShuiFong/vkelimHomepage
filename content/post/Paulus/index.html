<p><a href="/Paulus/">German and English libretto/text</a> to St. Paul (Paulus), an oratorio composed by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. As far as I can tell, this oratorio is infrequently performed or recorded these days. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mendelssohn-Paulus-Felix/dp/B000005GPP">good recording was made by EMI in 1977</a>. Some recordings do not include an English text!</p>
<p>This `translation’ was completed early in 2002. Also available as <a href="/document/Paulus.pdf">PDF version</a>, <a href="/document/Paulus.tex"><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span></a> and <a href="/document/Paulus.lyx">LyX</a> files. Please contact me regarding any errors.</p>
