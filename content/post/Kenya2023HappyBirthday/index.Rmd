Happy 13th birthday Spur!! 🎂 🤪👯‍♂️💃

Spur is really a teenager. 🤪☺️

I can't believe we have been running Spur for that long. We survived, well we are thriving! It was so so fun to celebrate a birthday with our Spur Kibera community - plus Andrew who has travelled to Kibera for training with us. 
It was so amazing to see our sponsored children serve others. They cooked all the food for the BBQ and washed all the dishes by hand. They chopped all the chips by hand! (Without chopping boards) It was especially nice to see our first sponsored child, Salim at the party dancing and serving us. Salim is going to university this year! That's also so good to witness. 

It did feel like a big family partying away. The teens really know how to celebrate. It's good to see how they are giving back to their community. 

Most of our high school graduates this year are all heading into college! What great news! We are really proud of them and I am praying we can see them finish university. 

Thanks for praying for our Spur community. I am praying for many more birthdays with cake 🎂.
