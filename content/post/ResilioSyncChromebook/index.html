<h2>Using Resilio Sync on Chromebook (using the ‘Crostini’ Linux container)</h2>
<p>Resilio Sync is available on Chromebook as an Android app (via the Google Play
Store), which is great, but:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for some reason, if I modify a synchronized file using a Linux application
(running in the <em>excellent</em> Crostini Linux application container), the Resilio
Sync app doesn’t seem to detect the change, and doesn’t propagate the changes
to the other computers</p></li>
<li><p>the Android app does not have all the features, such as easily visible logs,
as provided by the ‘web browser’ interface which operates on Linux/Windows
computers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>‘Resilio Sync’ for Linux can be operated inside a Chromebook ‘Crostini’ container!</p>
<p>Details on the how to ‘start’/use Crostini <a href="https://beebom.com/how-use-linux-chromebook/">can be found elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>Starting Resilio Sync on Crostini’s ‘Debian’ container can be found on
<a href="https://help.resilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206178924-Installing-Sync-package-on-Linux">Resilio Sync’s help pages</a>.</p>
<p>In summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Resilio Sync repository</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>echo &quot;deb http://linux-packages.resilio.com/resilio-sync/deb resilio-sync non-free&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/resilio-sync.list</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Add Resilio Sync public key</li>
</ul>
<p>On newer distributions:</p>
<pre><code>wget -qO- https://linux-packages.resilio.com/resilio-sync/key.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/resilio-sync.asc &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
<p>On older distributions:</p>
<pre><code>curl -L https://linux-packages.resilio.com/resilio-sync/key.asc | sudo apt-key add</code></pre>
<p>I previously used the instructions on <a href="https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/10961-crostini-howto-install-and-manage-resiliosync/">Leon’s blog</a></p>
<pre><code>wget -qO - https://linux-packages.resilio.com/resilio-sync/key.asc | sudo apt-key add -</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Update the repositories</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get update</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Install Resilio Sync</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y resilio-sync</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that Resilio Sync is auto-started (at least when a container is started)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable resilio-sync</code></pre>
<p>Sync’s web-interface is immediately accessible with the Chromebook’s
own ‘Chrome’ web-browser at <code>https://127.0.0.1:8888</code> (with an invalid certificate).</p>
<p>By default, the ‘Sync’ service is started by the <code>rslsync</code> user. The <code>rslsync</code> user is created
with a <code>rslsync</code> group. There will be a
directory named <code>/home/rslsync</code>, which I think is the best place for synchronized
files (which will have the owner <code>rslsync.rslsync</code>) to be placed. (The actual location
of synchronized files is determined when adding synchronized directories with
the web interface).</p>
<p>My ‘Crostini’ Linux user has a different name e.g. <code>frieda</code>.</p>
<p>How do I ensure that the ‘normal’ Linux user can read/write the synchronized files
which are in directories which have the <code>rslsync.rslsync</code> owner?</p>
<p>The Sync help web-pages suggest adding the <code>rslsync</code> group to the <code>frieda</code>
user etc. will help.</p>
<pre><code>sudo usermod -aG frieda rslsync
sudo usermod -aG rslsync frieda
sudo chmod g+rw /home/rslsync</code></pre>
<p>I didn’t find that was enough. What worked eventually for me was
<a href="https://kenfavors.com/code/how-to-add-user-permissions-to-a-folder-in-ubuntu/">adding user permissions to the <code>/home/rslsync</code> folder</a></p>
<pre><code>sudo setfacl -R -m &quot;u:frieda:rwx&quot; /home/rslsync</code></pre>

<h3>Using Resilio Sync on Chromebook Linux (Crsotini) as a regular user</h3>
<p>Some posts suggest running Sync as a local user instead, then placing the sync
folder in the user’s home directory, and adding rslsync user permissions to
that sync folder in the user’s home directory.</p>
<p>A method which worked well for me is described in <a href="https://frkd.dev/posts/2021-03-01-resilio-sync-linux-user/">the Forked</a>, which
suggests that the method recommended on the Resilio Sync website is <em>wrong</em> to
recommend directly editing the file <code>/usr/lib/systemd/user/resilio-sync.service</code>.
The reason is that file belongs to the Resilio Sync package, and will be
over-written when the package is updated.</p>
<p>Instead, Debian/systemd systems should use systemd drop-ins to modify the
service’s behaviour. These drop-ins overlay the systemd unit settings.</p>
<p>This is the suggested routine by Forked.</p>
<pre><code># Disable default service used to run as `rslsync` user
sudo systemctl stop resilio-sync.service
sudo systemctl disable resilio-sync.service

# Create a drop-in. Notice omitted sudo below this point.
systemctl --user edit resilio-sync.service

# At this point you&#39;ll get an editor opened where you need to
# add two following lines which will replace in initial unit file:
# [Install]
# WantedBy=default.target

# Now enable and start service as the current user.
systemctl --user enable resilio-sync
systemctl --user start resilio-sync</code></pre>
<p>All further commands to the Resilio Sync service should be issued with
<code>systemctl --user</code> without using ‘sudo’. The configuration file for the user
Resilio Sync service can be found in <code>~/.config/resilio-sync</code>.</p>
<p>This method suggested by Forked appears to be working well on my Asus CX9
Chromebook.</p>
