## Using Resilio Sync on Chromebook (using the 'Crostini' Linux container)

Resilio Sync is available on Chromebook as an Android app (via the Google Play
Store), which is great, but:

* for some reason, if I modify a synchronized file using a Linux application
(running in the *excellent* Crostini Linux application container), the Resilio
Sync app doesn't seem to detect the change, and doesn't propagate the changes
to the other computers

* the Android app does not have all the features, such as easily visible logs,
as provided by the 'web browser' interface which operates on Linux/Windows
computers.

'Resilio Sync' for Linux can be operated inside a Chromebook 'Crostini' container!

Details on the how to 'start'/use Crostini [can be found elsewhere](https://beebom.com/how-use-linux-chromebook/).

Starting Resilio Sync on Crostini's 'Debian' container can be found on 
[Resilio Sync's help pages](https://help.resilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206178924-Installing-Sync-package-on-Linux).

In summary

* Add Resilio Sync repository 

```
echo "deb http://linux-packages.resilio.com/resilio-sync/deb resilio-sync non-free" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/resilio-sync.list
```

* Add Resilio Sync public key

```
curl -L https://linux-packages.resilio.com/resilio-sync/key.asc | sudo apt-key add
```

I myself used the instructions on [Leon's blog](https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/10961-crostini-howto-install-and-manage-resiliosync/)

```
wget -qO - https://linux-packages.resilio.com/resilio-sync/key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

* Update the repositories

```
sudo apt-get update
```

* Install Resilio Sync

```
sudo apt-get install -y resilio-sync
```

* Ensure that Resilio Sync is auto-started (at least when a container is started)

```
sudo systemctl enable resilio-sync
```

Sync's web-interface is immediately  accessible with the Chromebook's
own 'Chrome' web-browser at `https://127.0.0.1:8888` (with an invalid certificate).

By default, the 'Sync' service is started by the `rslsync` user. The `rslsync` user is created
with a `rslsync` group. There will be a
directory named `/home/rslsync`, which I think is the best place for synchronized
files (which will have the owner `rslsync.rslsync`) to be placed. (The actual location
of synchronized files is determined when adding synchronized directories with
the web interface).

My 'Crostini' Linux user has a different name e.g. `frieda`.

How do I ensure that the 'normal' Linux user can read/write the synchronized files
which are in directories which have the `rslsync.rslsync` owner?

The Sync help web-pages suggest adding the `rslsync` group to the `frieda`
user etc. will help.

```
sudo usermod -aG frieda rslsync
sudo usermod -aG rslsync frieda
sudo chmod g+rw /home/rslsync
```

I didn't find that was enough. What worked eventually for me was
[adding user permissions to the `/home/rslsync` folder](https://kenfavors.com/code/how-to-add-user-permissions-to-a-folder-in-ubuntu/)

```
sudo setfacl -R -m "u:frieda:rwx" /home/rslsync
```
