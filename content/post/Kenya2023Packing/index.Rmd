Thank you Grace for helping us pack over 100kg of luggage and donated goods. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜Š Thank you Grace for taking us to the airport tomorrow.

Tomorrow is the day we fly off! We managed to get a upgrade for our 2nd flight so I am looking forward to something special. Thank you David Fong! It's a good new year surprise. We don't know when we will celebrate New year, most likely on the plane.

Please continue to pray for good health, safety and smooth travel.

We are still busy with preparing our Spur talks...I have a mentors day training to write and David has the Spur worker one to write.

Thanks for all the support, prayer and thoughts.
