<p>Thank you Grace for helping us pack over 100kg of luggage and donated goods. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜Š Thank you Grace for taking us to the airport tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the day we fly off! We managed to get a upgrade for our 2nd flight so I am looking forward to something special. Thank you David Fong! Itâ€™s a good new year surprise. We donâ€™t know when we will celebrate New year, most likely on the plane.</p>
<p>Please continue to pray for good health, safety and smooth travel.</p>
<p>We are still busy with preparing our Spur talksâ€¦I have a mentors day training to write and David has the Spur worker one to write.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the support, prayer and thoughts.</p>
