```

The [Wowchemy theme](https://wowchemy.com/) (formerly Hugo Academic) can 'tile'
irregularly shaped posts in a grid, using the [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/)
Javascript library. In [another post](/post/hugoacademicpagesascards/) I describe
how the 'cascading card' layout can be used in the Wowchemy's pages widget (used
for 'posts', 'talks' and 'publications'). Wouldn't it be nice to also use
the Isotope library for galleries within a post?

Another Javascript library, [fancybox](https://fancyapps.com/docs/ui/fancybox/) can
also be used for photo galleries. When a picture has a `data-fancybox` attribute, then
clicking on that photo results in a 'lightbox' view of the photo. Photos with the
same `data-fancybox` attribute can be seen in the same lightbox by clicking on
the right/left arrows, or using cursor keys.

The example below is taken from my [post on the topic of 'equity' after visiting
Kenya in 2021/2022](/post/kenya2021justice/). The code shown below is encased
in a ```` ```{r} ... ``` ```` code chunk.

The first part defines the CSS of `fancybox`, and then includes the Javascript of
`fancybox` and `isotope`. `isotope` has already been include by `Wowchemy`, but it
is not clear to me how to access that included Javascript code.

In a `div` of class `grid`, the `data-isotope` attribute is defined. This attribute
needs to be rather carefully escaped.

* `itemSelector` defines how isotope grid items class will be named in divisions which
contain gallery items. In this case, the class name will be defined as `isotope-grid-item`.
Note the added `.` period at the beginning of the name when the class name
is defined.

* the default layout is `masonry`. The `masonry` attribute is defined in the `div`
of class `grid`. I'm not actually sure how to change to a different layout! Or
whether changing the `masonry` attributes makes much difference!

  + `columnWidth` in this case is defined as the width of the HTML element with the
  `id` of `grid-sizer`. A period `.` is placed before the `id` name. By default,
  the column width is defined as the width of the first element in the `grid` div.
  Changing this attribute doesn't seem to make any difference to me, but to keep
  things safe, the first element in this `grid` will be a full-width element with
  the `id` of `grid-sizer`.
  
  + `percentPosition` allows grid item widths to be defined as percentages of
  available width. This attribute appears to work. In the example, this attribute
  is set to `true`
  
  + `gutter`, which borders the `grid` elements, in this example is set to zero (0)
  
As noted previously, it is safest to define the first element of the grid to
be the full width of the desired gallery. As the width of the first element in
the grid is the default width of the gallery.

Each element in the grid which is part of the gallery needs to have a `class`
definition which is the same as defined by `itemSelector` as mentioned above.

In the `style` attribute, the `width` can be defined as a percentage. The percentage
does not need to add up to 100%. Adjusting the percentages can help 'line' up the
rows to be of equal height.

The `data-fancybox` attribute in gallery items defines groups of photos as part
of the same lightbox display provided by `fancybox`.

In recent versions of [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the `href` and `img src` of
included pictures can be in the same directory as the post itself.

The images themselves do not have a default margin of zero pixels. Zero pixel
margins can be defined with the `style` attribute of the images.
