Flight is tomorrow night 10:55pm 🙂 

Please pray:

* I waited about 1.5 hours for my COVID test yesterday morning BUT my covid test
results still haven't come back yet (hopefully soon) but David Fong's result is
negative (yay! 😋) 
* smooth check-in process including travelling there
* we have all the correct documentation to board the flight 

Ongoing prayers for

* safety and peace for our families 
* kids and workers in Kenya (they are very excited to see us again!) 
* our worker Andrew in Kisumu who we are meeting for the first time! Pray that
we can communicate easily and that we have a safe time in Kisumu. That Andrew
will be able to share his vision for Kisumu with us. 

***our flight time including transit is 33 hours***

Pray that my travel sickness isn't too bad! I have medication but because I
haven't flown in a while I am a little scared. 

Also I am not so great at staying still... so please pray I can be occupied and
not bug David 🙁 

Let me know if you want more details!! Happy to share. 

Merry Christmas!! 

Yes, I will be spending my birthday on a plane or in transit? Haven't actually
figured out what time zone or where it is will be.... 🙁
