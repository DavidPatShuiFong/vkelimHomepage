<p>Flight is tomorrow night 10:55pm 🙂</p>
<p>Please pray:</p>
<ul>
<li>I waited about 1.5 hours for my COVID test yesterday morning BUT my covid test
results still haven’t come back yet (hopefully soon) but David Fong’s result is
negative (yay! 😋)</li>
<li>smooth check-in process including travelling there</li>
<li>we have all the correct documentation to board the flight</li>
</ul>
<p>Ongoing prayers for</p>
<ul>
<li>safety and peace for our families</li>
<li>kids and workers in Kenya (they are very excited to see us again!)</li>
<li>our worker Andrew in Kisumu who we are meeting for the first time! Pray that
we can communicate easily and that we have a safe time in Kisumu. That Andrew
will be able to share his vision for Kisumu with us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>our flight time including transit is 33 hours</em></strong></p>
<p>Pray that my travel sickness isn’t too bad! I have medication but because I
haven’t flown in a while I am a little scared.</p>
<p>Also I am not so great at staying still… so please pray I can be occupied and
not bug David 🙁</p>
<p>Let me know if you want more details!! Happy to share.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!!</p>
<p>Yes, I will be spending my birthday on a plane or in transit? Haven’t actually
figured out what time zone or where it is will be…. 🙁</p>
