Spur Afrika mobile clinics were held in January 2020, seeing children from several schools in Kibera, Kenya, and children sponsored by the Spur Afrika Elimsha program. Health activities included medical and dental checks, dental hygiene education and medication education. 938 children were seen, ranging in ages from seven to eighteen years, but mostly in the ten to fourteen year age group.

Respiratory, eye, dental and gastrointestinal conditions were the most common conditions seen.

Children sponsored by Spur Afrika were more likely to report that they had no outstanding medical complaints, reported brushing their teeth more often and were less likely to report respiratory complaints or complaints potentially attributable to air pollution, compared to children seen who were not supported by the Spur Afrika program.

This may be the outcome of better access to healthcare throughout the year e.g. due to arrangements with local medical staff - Dr. Simiyu and programs to encourage National Health Insurance (NHIF) uptake. The benefits of dental education, improved general education and financial support might also be responsible for improve health outcomes.

Children sponsored by Spur Afrika reported brushing their teeth more frequently than children not sponsored by the Spur Afrika program.
