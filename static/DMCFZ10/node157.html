...if you want nice paintings photos, the light must be on the
sides of the painting and not in front or, at least, with the external
flash, orient the flash toward the ceiling and/or use an accessory
(tinted glass, plastic...) to diffuse the light. I've done many
photos in exhibitions like that (yes, I was authorized to use flash
as I was one of the exhibitors)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For distortion, I use often Photoshop to remove it as I use this program
everyday for my work, but there is a VERY EASY and EFFECTIVE solution
: <A NAME="tex2html362"
  HREF="http://www.photofiltre.com">photofiltre</A>
is a free program and there is a free plugin available that is build
for removing fisheye distortion very easily.

<BLOCKQUOTE>I shot this morning a <A NAME="tex2html363"
  HREF="http://www.graphinc.com/photo/fisheye.jpg">photo</A>
of a frame I've made for year 2000 (a gift of the agency I was working
for his customers). Don't look the quality, I use no flash, there
was only a very little light and I wasn't really in front of it, but
you'll see the result. I didn't take time to set up correctly the
percent of distortion, so it's not perfect, but as you can see, only
one click change many things.

If it's oils or acrylics, you are going to get a lot of reflection
and they are best shot on a grey day. If you plop them in the shade
they will reflect the blue of the sky.

<BLOCKQUOTE>I do mine flat on the ground with the sun overhead.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Watercolors do not have as many problems, and I don't have to worry
about the sun causing glare, either, but make sure they are not shot
under glass &lt;G&gt;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You need photofloods and diffusers and reflectors if you shoot indoors.
Otherwise you get reflections and you get ``spot lighting'' on the
picture.

If you've got a tripod, or can borrow one, it'll make the whole thing
infinitely easier. Not only will you not have to worry about camera
shake, but once you establish your setup for the shots, you'll be
able to put the next painting in position, fine-tune your framing
with the zoom if the painting is a different size than the previous
one, and fire away. The 2-second setting on the self-timer should
come in really handy for this kind of stuff.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When you're setting things up, make sure that the front of the camera
lens is parallel with the surface of the painting. If you have enough
room, set the camera up far enough away from the painting to use the
3X-5X range of the zoom. Those two things should help minimize distortion
for you. Also, I'd recommend setting the camera to Manual and using
an aperture of f/5.6. That'll help give you good edge-to-edge sharpness
across the frame.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With digital you'll be able to tell right away how you're doing with
color balance, brightness, etc. You may need to play with the White
Balance a little to make sure the tones match those of the painting,
and aren't running a little warm or cool. If your lighting is going
to be consistent -- and if it's not you're gonna go nuts in no time
at all-it'll make exposure and color balance a whole lot easier.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I don't know if you know what a Grey Card is or not, but if you can
get one it'll simplify things too. A grey card represents the mid-point
between black and white, and setting your exposure off the card will
prevent the camera's meter from being fooled by paintings that are
predominantly bright or dark. If you can't get hold of a grey card,
the back of a Caucasian hand that's spent some time in the sun is
almost the same tone, as is a broken-in but not-too-faded pair of
Levi's. Once you set that basic exposure in Manual mode, you should
be in pretty good shape painting-to-painting as long as the light
stays constant.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The other thing you'll need to worry about will be reflections off
the surface of the painting. Oils are worse for that than, say, watercolors,
and that'll be your biggest challenge. If you can't find a lighting
angle that will eliminate the reflections, try diffusing the light
with something like a clean white sheet. You could use a polarizer,
but then you're going to run into problems with distortion because
you'll have to shoot at an angle. Polarizers are great, but they don't
eliminate reflections if you're shooting straight at the subject...
