First, to see what I'm (trying to) explain, put your camera in Manual
mode and set aperture to f/2.8 and shutter speed to at least 1 second.
Then, aim the camera at yourself so that you can peer into the lens
and see the small open iris way inside. Zooming back &amp; forth a bit
may help you spot the iris. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Next, while watching the open iris, press the shutter button. The
iris will remain open for the shutter time you've selected, then close
for the same length of time, and then open again. The time during
which it was closed is what I'm assuming is the ``dark-frame'' time. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the dark-frame time, the CCD accumulates a charge in each of
its sensors, just as it does while the shutter is open. If the CCD
was entirely noise-free, nothing would accumulate and a perfectly
black image would be captured. This is the same as what would happen
if you left the lens cap on while taking a picture in a darkened closet. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since no CCD is perfect, some charges accumulate even when there is
no light. That's noise. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since the conditions for taking the dark-frame image were identical
in all respects but one to those for taking the actual image (the
one difference being the availability of light), the assumption is
that both images accumulated the same noise level in each pixel. Both
images were taken at about the same time, same temperature, same duration;
and the resulting signals were boosted identically to satisfy the
ISO selection.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So, by subtracting the dark-frame readings from the exposed frame,
we should wind up with an image that has much less noise. Obviously,
this method does not work perfectly, because if it did, an ISO 400
picture would be completely noise-free, even better than what NeatImage
or NoiseNinja can do. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each pixel on the FZ10's sensor is about 2.5 micrometers on a side,
(1/10,000 inch). It doesn't take much to give them some charge. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you want to see an example of pure noise<A NAME="112"></A> on ANY digital
camera, take a long-exposure picture with the lens cap on, in a dark
room (the lens cap is not perfectly light-tight). Bring it into your
computer, then into a photo editor, and slide the bright end of the
LEVELS control towards the left. Eventually, you'll begin to see some
colored pixels. They tend to cluster. The closer you can get the LEVELS
to 0 before you see anything, the less
noise there is. If you take two of these black
pictures, one at the camera's minimum ISO and the other at its maximum
ISO, you will see a huge difference in the images as you slide their
LEVELS from 255 towards 0.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This only comes into operation with exposures longer than 1/2 second.
In order to see what the sensor noise is like, without the noise correction,
you can set the exposure to 8 seconds in manual mode, and then select
the rapid fire `burst' mode. This defeats the dark frame subtraction.
Then look at the resulting image in your editing program paying with
the histogram &amp; brightness controls to make it more obvious.
