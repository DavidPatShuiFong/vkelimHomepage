I recently made a perfectly functional eyecup out of a piece of pipe
insulation -- the tubular stuff you put on your cold water pipes
to keep them from sweating in the summer. It was probably for 3/4
inch pipe because the hole in the middle was bigger than the FZ10
eyepiece. I cut off a slice about 5/8 inches thick, cut it to length
so it fit snugly around the eyepiece, glued the ends together with
contact cement, and let it dry over night. I took a small scissors
and beveled the inside edge so only a narrow section touched my glasses.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now, this is not what you'd call pretty, but it blocks out all the
extraneous light and -- best of all -- it was free.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
And why would you want an eyecup anyway?

<P>
Wayne Lipe reports that cameras with a silver body (as opposed to
a black body) are in particular need of an eyecup when the camera
is used in bright conditions. The silver body reflects a lot of light.
The FZ10's eyepiece does not shield the EVF (electronic viewfinder)
adequately when used in bright conditions, making the EVF hard to
see. See also Section <A HREF="node19.html#sub:How-to-hold"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>, Wayne reports that an
eyecup help him hold the camera steady!

<P>


<P>
And are there any other benefits of an eyecup? <A NAME="tex2html280"

After waiting almost 2 days for the sun to come out I had a brief
period this morning to use my FZ10 out in bright sun in regards to
the eyecup I had been wanting to try. For me quite frankly the EV
{electronic viewfinder} would have been practically useless in direct
sunlight as I wear eyeglasses and prescription sunglasses outside.
I shot about 30 pics this morning using the eyecup while outside looking
directly into the sun and also being out in some pretty blinding snow
fields I was in ideal testing grounds. I can safely say using the
Nikon 2939 eyecup is about an 90 percent improvement over not using
any at all. After shooting with the cup in place I popped it off and
once again like I stated the EV was basically rendered useless with
my sunglasses on and the only way I could really utilize it was to
put the cup back on and press my eye up against it. The good thing
was the cup is pretty snug on the EV so no real need to glue it on
or anything it fits nicely.
