Single lens reflex (SLR)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
SLR means a Single Lens Reflex. This term was invented to designate
camera that were different from a DLR, Dual Lens Reflex, the archetypical
Roleiflex of the time. The Rolei also offer a reflex type of viewing,
that is the image is projected onto a screen via a 45 degree mirror,
but it does so via 2 separate lens, one for the viewing the other
for the sole purpose of taking the picture. Do not confuse DLR with
rangefinder camera where the viewing optic is a different window and
there is no reflex viewing.The problem with this is the slight parallax
problem when taking picture of close subject, as the viewing lens
is above the picture lens a slight difference exist if you are close
enough.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So when the technology advances and manufacturers were able to create
a camera that allow the viewing AND picture taking via the same lens,
the term SLR was born. Incidentally they did so by a system of mirror
that flip up and down just before taking the picture. Now that there
is only a single lens, one could easily change the lens to afford
a different viewpoint.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is where things gets a bit muddled, the term SLR is then conventionally
used to indicate a camera with single lens and reflex viewing AND
changeable lenses. Having said that, many years ago, Ricoh released
the Mirai and this was an SLR with a built-in x4 zoom (not changeable).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So if you refer to the original spirit of the word, i.e. a camera
that allow{s} you to see exactly what you are taking through the
same lens, then the FZ10 qualifies as an SLR (so do most digital cameras),
but if you refer to the letter of the word then the FZ10 does not
as it does not offer ``reflex'' style of viewing (and no changeable
lens). 

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Other than `through the lens (TTL)' viewing, I typically expect an
SLR to offer an <I>optical</I> view of the image passing through the
lens (and ultimately onto the film or digital capture device). Admittedly
this is not really in the definition of `SLR'. However, camera manufacturers
who claim that their camera is a `digital SLR' usually have an optical
viewfinder, rather than an electronic viewfinder (EVF).

<P>
One day electronic viewfinders may be as good as optical viewfinders
(and perhaps an electronic viewfinder might offer bonuses, such as
additional information and night-vision). Currently, however, electronic
viewfinders offer low resolution, poor contrast and usually low brightness
compared to an optical viewfinder. Electronic viewfinders have the
advantage of showing what is really happening on the digital sensor.
