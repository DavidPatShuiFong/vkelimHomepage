I've finaly got graduated ND filter, or how they call it split ND.
It's Tiffen Color Grad ND 0.6 (gradually reducing light by 2 stops
in one half of the filter)...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When I metered test scene without this filter, I used spot meter on
shadows and then highlights. I've got approximately about 7 stops
difference in readings from f/3.3-1/80 to f/6.3-1/2000. This range
was too big to be covered just by camera itself. Dynamic range of
FZ is about 5 stops, I've tested it some time ago. In this situation
to preserve details in shadows and highlights you have basically three
options.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Take two pictures with spot metering on shadows and highlights and
superimpose them in PS or PSP. PS CS2 has even special processing
for this. Pros: that you can increase dynamic range for more then
2 stops. Cons: practically difficult in the field. Tripod, static
scene, etc..
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Use Split ND filter which comes with 1/2/3 stops light reduction.
Pros: easy to use. Cons: generally only 2 stops coverage, need some
scene alignment with the filter, no dynamic range increase (since
it just reduces the light).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No filter at all. Expose to bright midtones and hope that shadow details
will be good enough after PS processing with shadows/highlight tool.
Pros: Even easier than with filter. Cons: Colors in shadows might
to grainy after PS processing. A bit of unnatural look.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I hope that split ND filter will help me to keep both highlight and
shadow details while taking a shot. Even the dynamic range of image
still will be about 5 stops, it's looking more naturally to eye, since
eye accommodate much wider range (I think it's about 10 stops).

The media in a camera only has so much dynamic range wheither it be
film or a CCD. That is the range from max brightness to minimun darkemess
is comtroled by the medium you are exposing. What a split ND will
do for you is compress this dynamic range in to something that the
camera media can handle more effectly. In other words increace the
dynamic range buy 2,3 or 4 stops by putting the breaks on the highlights.
You can't do this with f stop adjustment alone because all you are
doing there is moving the mid range exposure point around and you
are going to still be underexposed in the shadows and blow out the
highlights or vice versa.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The only other way, other than a split ND, to acheive saving both
the highlites and the shadows is to take 2 shots, one for the highlights
and one for the shadows and combine the two in Photoshop or something
similar. A simple way this could be done with software is to tahe
two shots as described above and useing some panorama software to
stich them together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The bottom line here is you can't do it with the camera alone, you
need some outside help. One solution I have used in the past is to
take a bunch of nice cloud pics an the use them to inhance a picture
that needs something in the sky. I remember spending hours in the
darkroom trying to get it right..
