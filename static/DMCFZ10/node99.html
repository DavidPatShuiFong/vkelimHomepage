<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of the cool uses for the 383 is to point it straight backwards.
The light bounces behind you and back to the subject all diffused
very nicely. You can get flash shots that don't look at all like flash
shots. Try it sometime and see what you think. You may have to bump
it up to the yellow or red range to trick it into giving enough light
however.

An example of using the Sunpak 383, bounce-flash and FZ-20 camera
can be found in <A NAME="tex2html191"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A couple of tips for when you get the Sunpak 383...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First of all, change the EXT FLASH option in the camera's Menu setting
from `Preset' to `Manual'. To do that, you'll have to have the flash
mounted in the camera's hot shoe. The flash doesn't need to be turned
on at that point: the fact that it's in the hot shoe will change the
EXT FLASH option from being greyed-out to active.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Making that change will allow you to shift the aperture value in P
mode using Program Shift. This will allow you to fine-tune your flash
exposures in 1/3-stop increments, meaning you can dial things in just
the way you want. One of the joys of shooting digital is the ability
to check the exposure right away, and make any necessary adjustments.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You'll probably do most of your indoor flash shooting in P mode because
that will keep the LCD and EVF bright enough for you to compose. The
default shutter speed for flash is 1/60, which is fine for most indoor
situations. I'd try leaving the flash in the Green A mode, and fine-tune
the exposure by changing the aperture with Program Shift.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You can probably shift to Yellow A mode for outside situations where
you can stop down more, but the fact that it's a 2-stop difference
between Green and Yellow means that the flash output is significantly
different. I wouldn't worry too much about having the camera's f-stop
match the one that the flash says to use. An easier approach is to
do a few test shots, check the results with the Review function, and
make the adjustments you need to. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The flash is capable of putting out the same amount of light on each
of the colored `A' settings, so you are not actually adjusting the
power output. What you are changing is the sensitivity of the light
sensor in the little green circle at the base of the flash.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On the Green setting, it assumes that you're using a large aperture
that lets more of the flash get to the film or CCD. Based on that,
it shuts the flash off sooner than it does on the other settings,
trying not to overexpose the scene. In some situations, that'll give
you the underexposure you're describing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On the Yellow settings, it assumes that you're using an aperture 2
stops smaller than the one for the Green setting. That's a significant
difference in terms of flash exposure, so it leaves the flash on longer
to get more light back through the smaller lens opening. If you keep
the same aperture you used for the Green setting, the scene is going
to be overexposed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On the Red setting, it assumes an aperture that 4 stops smaller than
the one for the Green setting. That's a huge difference, and it leaves
the flash on for a relatively long time, giving you massive overexposure
if you use the aperture you used for the Green setting.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>...the sensor on the flash has a 15-degree angle of view, which
is roughly equivalent to a 4X zoom setting on the camera lens. If
you're at a wider zoom setting, the flash will be measuring the light
in the center portion of the scene. If you're zoomed out farther than
4X, the flash will be `seeing' more of the scene than you are. If
there's something fairly dark and unreflective that it's seeing, it
may leave the flash on longer than you want; if there's something
fairly bright, or very reflective, it may turn the flash off sooner
than you want it to.
