Phayee.digital adapters</A>

<P>
At the time of writing (June 2004), these adapters<A NAME="1044"></A>
are hard to get. They were made in China, and being sold through<A NAME="tex2html206"
  HREF="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=43441&amp;item=3836494979&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW">e-bay</A>
(search for `jinfinance', or perhaps `phayee'), or try <A NAME="tex2html207"
  HREF="http://www.phayee.com/">Phayee web-site</A>
(in Chinese). As far as I can tell, Phayee.digital adapters<A NAME="1049"></A>
MAY be the same as those described <A NAME="tex2html208"
  HREF="http://home.kimo.com.tw/monkey.banana./PanaFZ10.htm">on this web-page</A>
or <A NAME="tex2html209"
  HREF="http://vipweb.url.com.tw/mschen3/">Chen Ming-Shan's web-page</A>
(also in Chinese). You can find some photographs on <A NAME="tex2html210"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On first examination the exterior of the adapter is not unlike the
original Panasonic FZ10 except that the Phayee.digital one is a two-section
adapter and the detachable section appears to have a 72mm thread at
one end.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It would also appear that the detachable section acts as a token lens
hood if you unscrew it you are then left with the main part of the
adapter which has a 62mm thread which will allow you to attach filters
etc. You can then just add for instance a 62mm UV filter then reattach
the detached portion of the adapter and you have an instant lens hood.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The confusion regarding the fact that Phayee.digital 62mm and 67mm
petal lens hoods could be attached to the adapter is easily understood
I also was totally confused until receiving the adapter! 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The 62mm lens hood does not actually fit the adapter itself, you need
to have a 62mm filter fitted then the lenshood is a 'push-fit' on
the filter and is secured by a thumb screw.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The 67mm filter fits the exposed threads on the adapter that are normally
used for attaching the detachable section of the adapter.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once again the 67mm lens hood is a push fit and no damage can be caused
to the thread as the lens hood has a rubber insert where the lens
hood attaches to the adapter, you then use the lens hood thumb screw
to fix the petal shaped hood in the desired position.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As regards quality the adapter is well made and fits the FZ10 well
and is a good buy if you do not wish to go the Yoshida or Peramaal
route, although aesthetically I prefer the Yoshida and Peramaal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am pleased with the petal lens hoods as I can also use them on my
film camera as well due to their fixing method, the only problem is
that it would be quite easy to lose the thumb screw so will be using
a piece of tape over the thumb screw once the lens hood is secured
in place.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hoods are plastic with a metal mount which is a matt black although
I can see the odd spot of metal showing through the matt black paint
although it is just a case of touching up the matt black paint. There
is a rubber insert fitted in the metal mount to ensure a good fit
on either filter or adapter and also it will ensure that neither is
marked when fitting the hood.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Overall the Phayee.digital items purchased off eBay are for me at
least good value for money and the adapter is capable of being used
with filters and add-on lenses.
