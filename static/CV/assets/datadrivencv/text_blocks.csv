intro,"I enjoy the opportunity of working with fellow health-workers in a culturally and linguistically diverse community in suburban Australia. When the opportunity arises, I also work and volunteer overseas.

I appreciate the opportunity to both learn and share knowledge with team-members and students in Australia and elsewhere, such as in China and Kenya.

I particularly enjoy examining clinical data, and considering how data may be used to improve patient care, improve clinical processes and further the health of communities."
