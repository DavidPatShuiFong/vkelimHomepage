Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let ev'ry heart prepare Him room

::: notes

Separate each slide with a '---' line
each '---' separating a slide needs a blank line *before* and *after* the '---'

*optionally* bottom-left information (e.g. copyright) can be added
to a slide with using '#' at the beginning of the line (a markdown 'title')

generate powerpoint from '.md' markdown file with
"pandoc --to pptx --from markdown+hard_line_breaks --reference-doc pandoc_pptx_reference_worship.potx --output output.pptx lyrics.md"
'hard_line_breaks' treats each new line as a 'line break' (which is what you want)

And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world the Savior reigns
Let all their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks hills and plains

---

Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat the sounding joy

---

Joy unspeakable joy
An overflowing well
No tongue can tell

---

Joy unspeakable joy
It rises in my soul
Never lets me go

---

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness

---

And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders wonders of His love
